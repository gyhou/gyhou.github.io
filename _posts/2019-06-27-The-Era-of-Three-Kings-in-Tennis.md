I just published The Era of Three Kings in Tennis on Medium! https://link.medium.com/FCvjpknrSX

While sports generally favors the fit and young athletes, it does not hold true for tennis any longer.
There is a clear trend that the age of professional tennis players have gotten older in the recent decades.
Particularly, Roger Federer, now 37 years old was still able to miraculously won 3 more Grand Slam titles
last couple of years after his previous majors title at 32 years old.
