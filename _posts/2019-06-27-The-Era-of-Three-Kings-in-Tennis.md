I just published <a href="https://link.medium.com/FCvjpknrSX">The Era of Three Kings in Tennis</a> in Tennis on Medium! 

While sports generally favors the fit and young athletes, it does not hold true for tennis any longer. There is a clear trend that the age of professional tennis players have gotten older in the recent decades. Particularly, Roger Federer, now 37 years old was still able to miraculously won 3 more Grand Slam titles last couple of years after his previous majors title at 32 years old.
