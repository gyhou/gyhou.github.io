I deployed a Yelp Business Recommendation API (http://br-yelp-predict-rating.herokuapp.com) using machine learning to help business owners understand the key elements 

Using [Yelp's official dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), I trained a model to predict user's future blood glucose level base on insulin intake, previous blood glucose measurements and the time it was measured.

My API takes in a json string inside a list of measurements, preferably 3+ days worth of measurements around breakfast, lunch and dinner. After sending the input to our API, it will respond with measurements predicting the next day blood glucose level before and after each meal.

The input codes represents the following:
```
33 = Regular insulin dose

```

Example input:
```python
val = [{"id": 1,

```
        
Example Output:
```python
{'Pre-breakfast me
```
