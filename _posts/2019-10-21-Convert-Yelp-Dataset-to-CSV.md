Round 13 of the Yelp dataset challenge started in January 2019 providing students the opportunity to win awards and conduct analysis or research for academic use.

I wrote an article [Convert Yelp Dataset to CSV](https://towardsdatascience.com/converting-yelp-dataset-to-csv-using-pandas-2a4c8f03bd88) to demonstrate a step-by-step of how to load the gigantic file of the Yelp dataset, notably the 5.2 gigabytes worth of review.json file to a more manageable CSV file. With over 6 million reviews in the review.json file, it could be troublesome to load inside a Jupyter Notebook. After successfully converting the dataset, check out my next post for [explorative data analysis with visualization](https://towardsdatascience.com/analyzing-yelp-dataset-with-scattertext-spacy-82ea8bb7a60e) of the dataset!

The code used for this is located in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gyhou/yelp_dataset).
