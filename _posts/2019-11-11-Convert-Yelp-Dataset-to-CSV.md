My article on Medium, [Convert Yelp Dataset to CSV](https://towardsdatascience.com/converting-yelp-dataset-to-csv-using-pandas-2a4c8f03bd88) serves to demonstrate a step-by-step of how to load the gigantic file of the Yelp dataset, notably the 5.2 gigabytes worth of review.json file to a more manageable CSV file. With over 6 million reviews in the review.json file, it could be troublesome to load inside a Jupyter Notebook.

The code used for this is located in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gyhou/yelp_dataset).
