One of the most crucial work in the text mining field is to present the content of the text data visually. Using natural language processing (NLP), a data scientist can summarize documents, create topics, explore storylines of the content in different angles and scope of details.

My article on [Analyzing Yelp Dataset with Scattertext spaCy](https://towardsdatascience.com/analyzing-yelp-dataset-with-scattertext-spacy-82ea8bb7a60e) will explore the [Yelp's Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/) using Scattertext to visualize and analyze the text data.

A sample Scattertext html can be found [here](http://gyhou.com/RV-Parks-Campgrounds-Yelp-Reviews-Scattertext.html).

The code used for this is located in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gyhou/yelp_dataset).
