For this project ***using only built-in Python libraries***, we want to know for each financial product and year, the total number of complaints, number of companies receiving a complaint, the company with the most complaints, and the highest percentage of complaints directed at a single company.

The federal government provides a way for consumers to file complaints against companies regarding different financial products, such as payment problems with a credit card or debt collection tactics. This project will be about identifying the number of complaints filed and how they're spread across different companies.
