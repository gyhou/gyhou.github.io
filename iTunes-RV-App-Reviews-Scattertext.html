When I first installed and ran this app, it asked for my email address to see if I already had an account on one of their websites and it recognized I was a user of RV Trip Wizard. I entered my RV Trip Wizard password and I was in. However, when I tried to view my RVTW saved trips, it wouldn't work. I sent a customer service request on July 4 of all days, and got a quick response. It turns out I had to log out of the app and back in again. No big deal, but something they should correct in the app.\n\nI had created a trip to an Ohio state park about 3 hours from my house and used the \"rv friendly\" routing option. I tested the route with and without the rv friendly routing to see how the routing would be different. With standard routing, it had me take a country road the final 30 minutes and with the \"rv friendly\" routing, it had me take the Turnpike for most of that final 30 minutes, which made sense. However, it had me get off the turnpike and drive down a narrow but paved country road for about 15 minutes. That was odd, since a few miles further down the Turnpike there was an exit for a state route that would have taken much closer to the campground. That was odd, but the route didn't take me anywhere I couldn't get through so I didn't worry about it too much. Incidentally, RV Trip Wizard online gave me the better route using the state route but this did not carry over into the app integration.\n\nOn the way home, it routed me via the state route I mentioned above and that made more sense to me, but I don't know why it was different. However, the BIG deal is on my way home it attempted to route me down a road by my house that is closed from June to October 2019. Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze apps all knew to to route around this road closure but RV Life did not. In addition, there was a long backup on I-75 through Findlay due to construction. Again, RV Life did not alert at all or route around it, while Google Maps and Waze both did. \n\nGiven these issues, I don't have enough trust in the GPS routing in the RV Life app to recommend using it. I will try again next Spring and hope the routing has improved. I will continue to use RV Trip Wizard to map the route and then export to Google Maps. That process is a pain, but I trust the routing more. Like any GPS routing, you need to use your common sense and consult a map if something doesn't seem right.", "As a newbie I was overwhelmed with the apps available and what to use.

That\u2019s not a solution. \n Get a true support group that responds. \n\nDO NOT INSTALL TO TEST UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY ANNUALLY WITH MO WAY TO CANCEL.", "I only use the app to locate campgrounds, hence I find the interface a bit annoying.

So far I find Copilot clumsy. I still run Google Maps simultaneously to ensure I take the right or best route. I got a ticket in NY as approached the Midtown Tunnel after Copilot directed me to miss my exit from the Long Island Expressway to the BQE because it changed my route without asking me or alerting me. This mistake sent me toward the tunnel, which I knew I could not take. I was looking for a way out. Fortunately the cops helped me out of a jam, but gave me a ticket in the process. \n\nHere are my specific issues. \nCo pilot problems \n\n1. Changes route without asking me or letting me know \n2. Highway and city names too small to read. Does not get larger when I zoom in. \n3. Has routed me on some routes that are clearly not truck routes and physically impossible for a truck (and yes, my profile has 53\u2019 trailer with 13\u20196\u201d  height).\n4. Algorithms find very convoluted routes that are inefficient, jump off highways and add unnecessary miles and time, and finds routes that go right through traffic with lots of intersections and lights. \n5. Often picks a route in the opposite direction with a u-turn to get back on track. \n6. Does not know how to control the play/pause function when connected to radio/speakers. Often goes silent. \nCauses me to miss turns/exits because of #1 above. \n7. Too many colors and not clearly identified routes, worse in night mode. Look at Google and iMaps. Very clear. \n8. When I try to force it to take a specific route, rather than going direct through the desired route, it goes through the original route, then back-tracks and adds lots of twists. \nI would appreciate info as to what developer is doing to fix these problems, or I have search for another app, especially since I am paying for this Trucker GPS. I really need an effective and efficient trucker GPS, especially in the northeast where getting off route can be very dangerous. If this one doesn\u2019t get fixed, I have to search for another.

Highly recommend \ud83e\udd14", "I bought this years ago & was annoyed that my purchase didn\u2019t count for anything when it moved to a subscription model. However, I need a reliable GPS on my phone for our RV travels. This isn\u2019t it. On the first trip while using it Copilot directed us down a road that we should never have been on. I don\u2019t blindly follow GPS instructions but neither Apple Maps nor my paper map indicated anything to raise alarms. After we turned into this narrow country road with swamp each side and no shoulders we reached a sign saying that there was no access for vehicles over 1/2 ton or longer than 20 feet. We\u2019re 16 tons and 40 feet and there was no area to turn around. Backing half a mile down a country road to turn back into a busy state highway was great fun. \nCopilot wouldn\u2019t reroute. It kept telling us to turn back onto that road. \nThe second time, it routed us onto city streets that had low (very low, one was 9\u2019) overpasses. Luckily, I picked up on that before we turned off. Then the app wouldn\u2019t reroute. \nThird & last time, I ran copilot concurrently with MapQuest, and ran Apple Maps on the iPad alongside. Copilot lost signal and ran around in circles, then tried to turn us around to start the route over. Neither of the others lost our position. Copilot is now uninstalled and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to any truck or RV driver.", "I bought this app many years ago specifically for the RV features. Now those have been removed and the only way to get them is to get an annual subscription. Sorry, I\u2019m not paying a subscription for something I previously had.", "It\u2019s good, just wish it had a few more features like satellite view and maybe if it wasn\u2019t so zoomed in so close all the time.

If that\u2019s an actual security measure (can paste into email field) I shudder to think what your actual privacy measures are. Deleted.", "This review is intended for professional drivers only. I almost never write reviews on anything, but this app deserves some attention. As you can guess, I have a pretty high opinion of this app, giving it 4 stars, but keep in mind my rating is a comparative one, based on my experience with 3 other \u201ctruck\u201d GPS apps.\n\nWhat I like about it:\n\nThe interface is beautifully laid out with large selection buttons, making doing almost anything on the app easy and it\u2019s pleasing to look at and use. \n\nThe navigation for trucks is at least as good as fixed units from Garmin or RM (I have used both and currently use Garmin for primary navigation). There are some bugs, which I will mention later, but it\u2019s still better and more reliable than other apps. \n\nThe included POI\u2019s (truck stops, rest areas, etc.) is good. I can\u2019t rave about this feature for any app or fixed based unit because they are all lacking in my opinion, but this one is on-par with most, at least in terms of quantity. I do have a big POI issue though, which I will mention later. \n\nLots of options for customization whether it\u2019s how the map looks, voice prompts, route choices and much more. \n\nThe \u201cActive Traffic\u201d is probably better than Garmin and I would say equal to Google. I also like the way it can display a traffic bar alongside the map, making it very easy to see where the slowdowns are on your route. \n\nWhile not as important, this app does something I\u2019ve never seen from any other GPS, fixed unit or app: in most cases it will show you the layout of \u201croads\u201d within a truck stop or customer lot. And it\u2019s pretty accurate. Can guide you correctly through a truck stop maze right to the fuel island. \n\nFor those that don\u2019t run the posted speed limit, the app allows you to set a \u201cgovernor\u201d speed to help more accurately estimate drive and arrival times. Coupled with the traffic feature, this can allow for some very accurate ETA\u2019s. That said it would be even better if it would just let you set a \u201cdrive\u201d speed, because if you drive faster than the speed limit, it will still only calculate ETA based on the limit (I don\u2019t know many truckers who actually drive 55 while in California... most are doing 58-62). \n\nWhen planning a route, it will show you up to 3 different truck-legal options. In addition, after you\u2019ve chosen a route, customizing it is a breeze. This is helpful especially if you just want to alter one little section or a customer has provided specific directions for the \u201clast mile\u201d. This function is easier and better to use than any other GPS I\u2019ve used, including fixed units. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t like:\n\nTwo big things I don\u2019t like that are largely responsible for my not rating this app 5 stars and even leave me questioning the 4 star rating I did give it. \n\nFirst, the cost. For an app that runs on user-purchased hardware (aka smartphone), the price is ridiculously expensive. At $9.99 mo. or $99.99 yr., it can easily add up to as much as or more than a fixed unit over time. I think a one-time purchase price would make sense. Would I be willing to pay $99.99 to have it for life? Probably. It\u2019s good enough to justify that amount once, but not year after year. \n\nSecond, and this may not be as important to some as it is to me, but when searching for upcoming POI\u2019s on-route, it will only look about 30 miles ahead. If you\u2019re like me and start looking for a lunch/fuel/night stop at least a couple of hours out, this app is useless. Because of that, I find myself switching between this app and others, like TP, to figure out what\u2019s up ahead in the next 100-200 miles, then switching back, doing a POI search near a specific city, then adding the POI to my route. I\u2019ve contacted customer support about this and to their credit, and my surprise, they actually responded and did a follow up. Unfortunately, their response was basically \u201csorry, but that\u2019s just the way it is and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it\u201d. This flaw and their response make no sense to me because if you do a POI search for \u201cnearby\u201d, the resulting list is long and can list places as far as 300 miles away. The problem is you have no way of knowing if any of those places are on your current route or not.\n\nOther, more minor things, I don\u2019t like include not having the ability to set alerts for things that are important, especially for professional drivers, like upcoming weigh stations, sharp curves or steep grades. These should be basic implementations in a truck-based app, especially one at this price point. \n\nThe zoom control on the 3D map is very limited. Want a wide view of your route? Forget it. You can only zoom out about a mile or two. Fortunately, the 2D map doesn\u2019t have the same limitations and even has an auto \u201czoom to next turn\u201d option. My Garmin does this also AND does it in 3D view. Since I\u2019m primarily using this app as a \u201cbackup\u201d to my Garmin, I kind of like the 2D view to give me different perspective. One little bug though is that when I am more than about 20 miles from the next turn, it displays the map in a \u201cnorth up\u201d orientation even though I have my settings for \u201cheading up\u201d. Once within 20-25 miles, it switches to heading up view. \n\nAnother minor bug I found was that it planned a route exactly as I wanted, but after parking for the night and starting the next morning, it had changed my route. I cancelled the navigation and re-entered the destination, but it still wouldn\u2019t take me on this particular road. So, first it would and then it wouldn\u2019t. Have no idea why. \n\nI\u2019ve found two stretches of interstate 5, one southbound in California and one northbound in Oregon, that the app showed as closed when they actually weren\u2019t. If you zoomed in to the right spot, you could see where the road was black, marking it as closed. Because of this, it wouldn\u2019t even let me manually alter the route to force it to stay on the interstate. Took me forever to figure out why it was trying to route me off a valid highway and take me an extra 100 miles out of the way.", "You have to pay again yearly! That\u2019s a no no for me.", "Asked the app to plot a route from Mechanicsburg, PA to East Meadow, NY... The app provided the first turn audibly, and then the audio quit for the rest of the trip!!!

I am deleting the app, and highly advise against its use!!!!!", "I purchased this app specifically because it is supposed to be designed for RV use. First attempt to use it was to go to a campground in N Calif. The app didn\u2019t have the campground in its database although both Google and Apple navigation had the campground on their database.  Second use worked ok it it was to an RV park in a city.  Third time it guided me down a narrow winding dirt road that was barely passable in our 30 foot RV when a perfectly good paved route was available ( same route as Google maps).  This was exactly the sort of situation I had hoped this app would avoid. It appears that it is no improvement over Google maps. Also I find the interface to be not terribly intuitive.

Luckily my wife noticed we were headed towards a cluster and busted out Google Maps which got us through town in one piece.\n\nOnce not driving I checked out the routes chosen by copilot and by sygic using the same vehicle parameters....6 tons, 50 length, 8ft wide, 13\u2019 tall....for my trailer plus truck. \n\nSure enough, copilot kept sending me through downtown Livermore along first street.  Sygic bypassed downtown on roads that were more appropriate for a rig just passing through.", "Living in the mountains of WV and pulling a rig totaling 55 plus feet leave me wanting to stay straight roads as much as possible. This app often suggests routes that are narrow and very curvy. Selecting a two lane road verse a four lane to save a few minutes seems to me like bad logic. I'm not even confident that the selected route considers my rig dimensions,when making some of these suggested routes. Being a new user, I may grow more confident but based on my limited use It is not worth the cost.", "This app gives you the ability to enter the dimensions of your rig and I would assume it would use that information to give you relevant features. For example, search for truck stops along my route. Nope!  I can search for gas stations, but that doesn\u2019t include truck stops. If I need a truck stop, I have to search for it by name. So, I use multiple apps (RVParky is awesome) to find truck stops and then search for it by name in Copilot. \n\nAnother issue with this app is there is no way to update a map and save changes, instead you have to remember the name of the file (including capitalization) and save over the file.  Not a deal breaker, but a sign of rookie developers. This is a simple change and should have been done from the beginning. \n\nThere are a lot of features in this app that you better get familiar with before you learn the hard way. For example, I included a highway service area as a stop and the service area divides the cars from the trucks. The program told me to stay right (cars) but I stayed left since I\u2019m in a large RV. Apparently the lanes were just far enough apart that the app routed me 45 minutes out of the way and took me right back to the same service area. I will edit my trip from now on by deleting stops as I come to them. This delay cost me a night at a campground while we slept at another service area for the night. So, this app has already cost me more money than just purchasing it.\n\nI would think long and hard about choosing this over a Rand McNally GPS!  I wish I had spent the money on a device instead of this app. But, I\u2019m still using it and holding out hope that the developers make the necessary improvements.

I am not sure if they have put it in a premium addition but I can no longer find it in the update or as an in-app purchase.  I\u2019ve been using Copilot for several years and it has always been my goto app especially when I get lost.  That being said, use with extreme care, as you should with all navigation devices.  For the majority off the time Copilot has been very good throughout Canada and the US as I travel very extensively. However, I once let my guard down and nearly ran out of gas a long way from any town.  The discovery was made when it routed me to a graveled forest service road.  It was 60 miles to get back on track and to the nearest gas station.  Check other resources and question the choices made by Copilot.  It makes mistakes too and when it can be a life or death situation use extra caution when vectored through less traveled routes.  Still, it has been a valuable app and has helped me many times, especially being in the proper lane for an exit.  I still recommend it and with the voice directions.  I do not recommend the Apple TTS voice as that will drive you insane with annoyance as it reads every little detail.  I go with Lisa.  I removed a star because the dropped the RV profile.  Also the information for this app is incorrect as it still includes RV specs not found in the app.  This is misleading.  I tested the update on an older device and will not be upgrading on my new devices because I use the RV profile for highway speed and preferences.

We just completed a 14,000 mile trip back and forth across the US.  Initially we noticed more problems with routing, even being directed under a 10\u2019 bridge with our 13\u2019 RV.  That was something that had never happened before, and we had always trusted the App.  The road mapping just didn\u2019t seem to be working as well, and we were happy to see a required update with new maps come out.  As instructed by ALK Tech we updated the app, removed the old maps and installed new.  WE CAN NO LONGER TRUST THIS APP.  We were incorrectly directed onto bridges that do not allow vehicles over 24\u2019 in length, that were too low, onto roads that don\u2019t allow vehicles of our size, onto off ramps on freeways, only to be directed right back on to the same freeway, and to incorrect locations.  Everything we could trust before, cannot be trusted any longer.  Our account seems to have been downgraded to a Demo account, although we actually had a Premium account before the upgrade, and I cannot get any help from the tech team.  DO NOT INVEST IN THIS APP - until you start seeing better reviews come through.  It is inconvenient at best, with all the mistakes in routing, and very dangerous at the worst with the risk you run of being put into a bad situation with a long, tall RV.", "I was reviewing gps apps and this one so far seems the best. It is fast and reliable in its navigation.  I would much rather use offline gps apps like copilot since they do not rely on cell signal which are not available everywhere and why use cell data if u dont need to.  The traffic feature does use cell data but only a little and u can turn that off if u want when going overseas etc. i like also that u can download certain areas of the usa or europe maps which saves space.", "Works great on a windows phone but not very user friendly on an iPhone", "Finally used this for a few thousand mile trip and can definitely state that it is dangerous. Had the profile set to RV and 13 foot high. It guided me off the main route to my destination, then navigated to a narrow lane through the woods to get back to the main road. I managed to avoid this disaster by making a K-turn and going back to the main road, then drove past the \u201croad\u201d it had wanted me to take. It didn\u2019t exist. Somewhere between where it wanted me to turn and the intersection with the main road, it dead ended. Had I taken it I would have had to try to back my 35 foot trailer nearly a mile, assuming I didn\u2019t get stuck in a muddy rut. DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!\n\nPros - can add RV height to the vehicle to avoid low bridges (really a great help); can create and store trips for future use; maps can be loaded in sections to conserve space - maps are used offline.\nUpdate - in traveling with our RV, we like to avoid interstate highways. Most gps apps and devices have an option to avoid highways. If selected, you end up with ridiculous routes sometimes hundreds of miles out of the way. This app provides a selection of options where you can select how strongly you want to avoid highways. Then it routes on interstates only where it makes sense. Good feature that should be in all navigation devices/apps,\n\nNeutral - provides lane guidance that has become standard; options for routing includes standard avoidances including dirt roads.\nUpdate - the lane guidance is definitely behind the state of the art and desperately needs updated. \nWhile the map information does not need any internet, traffic conditions (available via paid subscription) does require internet.\n\nCons - no way to get speech working with Chrysler Uconnect if also using hands free phone; graphics for lane guidance pretty poor; speed limit info seems very limited; traffic info requires yearly subscription;\nUpdate:\nSpeed  limit display :unlike every other nav device and app, speed limits are only available for interstates, rendering it mostly useless.\nRouting: Seems to route through the middle of towns and ignores bypasses when not on an interstate. Very irritating with an RV. \nPOIs: basically totally useless. Most are flat wrong. Indicating gas or food where there are only fields.\nText to speech on Apple- this is terrible. There is one voice that cannot be heard over normal road noise that does text to speech. Other voices have great volume but are irritatingly generic with statements like - exit in 2 miles. You have to look at the screen to see what the exit is called.\n\nUpdate overall: not clear that the serious problems out weigh the advantages. Still searching for a really good navigation app but this definitely isn\u2019t it.", "The speed limit alert does not show, even after I set it up in settings.  If this worked, it would be good.\nReported this a couple times already, but still not fixed.  2 Nov 2018.", "The big problem I have found for an RVer is no searching from state and national parks. The way around is to search address in another app then make it a contact then I can map it. It would also be nice to be able to put a stop in the trip.", "I originally bought CoPilot a few years ago to use while driving through Italy. It was a dream -it enabled me to falling back roads, drive without using cellular data and gave crisp voice directions which guided me through town by town.\n\nUnfortunately, this new version is unusable. When I bought the new version for Spain and Portugal I found that the cost was $25, because I could not purchase a single country map. The new version is inaccurate (the red dot indicating where you are is constantly humongous around and almost caused a number of accidents as I swerved to take an exit at the last second). It does not contain Voice (unless you pay an additional $18) and is impossible to figure out. I am usually very good with technical matters, but this one continually eludes me. Simply said, I hate it! The old version was terrific and this one is worse than asking a two-year-old child for directions.", "This gps often shows incorrect street signs, or exit names. I often missed my exit off the expressway because the gps showed something different than what I was looking at in real life. It was very frustrating. It\u2019s just not as accurate and up to date as more popular gps\u2019s. I also didnt like that there wasn\u2019t an option to pause your music or podcast while the turn-by-turn voice spoke. Other gps will do that and this one wont. I also found that it will sometimes randomly redirect you even if you were on the path it told you to be on. It\u2019s just not a great app. I wanted something different than apple maps, but this app is only different in negative ways.", "This is a great innovative flexible and easy to use navi app you don\u2019t need to use your data connection but recommends to turn better accuracy which helps it coordinate but it\u2019s not always accurate with directions but a lot of navi apps have them issues as well. One problem I noticed is when you want to search for a business or like a location it may not show up in search. But seems to be getting even better over the years. So for the price of $10 for voice turn instructions and the functionality and reliably I would recommend this app as current version!", "Anytime I need direction , cell service or not it never lets me down.", "The team should be congratulated for their effort. This is a great app. Two things come to mind that make me a fan. The Maps are resident on your phone, so if you travel to an area (like mountains) with no cell service you don\u2019t have anxiety about if you phone will have all the data it needs to properly navigate. The other is the traffic bar, you can \u201csee\u201d out 100 miles and know what\u2019s coming.", "I\u2019ve found this app to be very easy to use, intuitive and clearly designed to fit the users needs!", "The majority of the time this app works really well.

Not the verbal directions.\nThere is a one-way street in my neighborhood, and the app always has me going down the one-way street in the wrong direction.", "This app is so much more flexible than the other gps apps I\u2019ve used!  I love that I can control the look of the app, set my preferences, easily change routes,etc. HOWEVER, I don\u2019t like that the routing instructions are frequently wrong and sometimes even dangerous!  Yesterday in Philadelphia, it told me to take several turns that were the wrong way on one way streets. Then it tried to get me to drive past my exit, go a mile, make a u-turn and go back to my exit!  When I ignored it and just took my exit, it kept trying to route me back until I got 10 miles up the road - then it gave up. I am using the latest version of the app and the latest update of the maps.  In summary, love the app most of the time but very frustrated with some of the routing instructions.", "I upgraded to this version on 7 October 2018\n\nSince then I have had a number of issues with the program and basically it is not functioning for me .\nIn this version, CoPilot is unable to find any route to any destination.\nI have contacted CoPilot to report this as a problem, but would suggest that new uses might want to wait a few days to see if this issue gets fixed", "So, my data is unpaid.

Two issues, one was exporting all contacts from the old HD app to CoPilot cloud then importing them into this new app, it didn't import them.  Second issue is the voice, it should use Apple TTS but the voice is not Siri like, it's a low toned male-ish terrible robot voice, yuk!  What's with that?!?

I like this feature. However, the program itself has issues, depending on how you use it. I chase storms and used it on my iPad this season in conjunction with a Bluetooth GPS device. I like to use the program in 2D map mode for situational awareness. I like that the map can be locked in the \u201cnorth up\u201d position. But while it\u2019s great for up-close views of the next farm road or the next few turns, when one zooms out even a little to plan a route, even major roads (U.S. routes and interstates) completely vanish, and others appear as segments if they appear at all. I understand secondary roads vanishing when zooming out, but major ones? The company says this is a \u201cfeature\u201d that is not a priority at this time.

This one is well-designed to use/see while you're driving. It has viewing modes.  It's very unique in that while moving it will adjust the route automatically, lets you preview the route, route planning with easy to add waypoints, accepts place marks, and offers a parking mark when you arrive.  I bought the Lifetime Navigation. \n\nPreview/Plan Routes!!  You can preview the route in detail.  Plus planning with uniquely easy waypoints - adding stops along the way - and routing between stops.  Most nav apps don't permit a preview of a route in detail.   It's helpful to see or get familiar with the road names and route.  Other nav apps only show you entire routes in one distant view.  Only when you hit \"Go\" can you see the route detail.  Beyond annoying.\n\nAuto Reroute!!  When I go off the route due to detour, missed turn, or whim, it changes the route based on where I am - not where I should be.  It does so quickly, ex. in a neighborhood, if you miss a turn/road it will adjust the route to the next turn/road.  Fantastic when there's a detour or traffic jam, you just go elsewhere and it will keep you going forward from there. It does NOT repeat \"turn around\" over and over and direct me to Uturn at each intersection I drive past.  Can't cancel/restart a route, it's difficult while driving and usually they go back to the same route you got off of.  So I have to turn other nav apps off. \n\nWish:  need a Watch app.  One with next route step view and hepatic turn indication.\n(Like the Apple Map.)   \n\nThanks for a great app!", "I put in a city and street that was 10 min ride it could not find the street and said the city was over an hour away!!

Really?\n\n(HINT:  not everyone uses GPS to find restaurants and clubs to connect with friends after work.)\n\nThe beauty of Copilot used to be this: when you couldn't find a destination in Copilot's built-in database,  you could type (or better: dictate) the name of the business (e.g., a lawyers office, or plumbing supply store) into the Google search box, click on the Google result, and Copilot would automatically capture the business' address, plug it in and start plotting the route.  No more, because (1) and somehow this may come as a surprise to the developers:  Yelp is NOT AS POWERFUL as Google, and (2) to be honest, Yelp doesn't really care all that much about businesses that aren't dining or entertainment venues (so good luck with that plumbing supply store).\n\nThe two litmus tests I now use for GPS apps: (1) do the developers insist that you authorize them to track your whereabouts, by turning on location services, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING THEIR APP?  If so, I click on the little \"x\" and delete the app.   Three words: NOT DOING THAT.  (I'm looking at you Waze, and others) \n\nLitmus test #2?   I type the name of locally well-known business I visit regularly into the search box.  Does the GPS accept business names or just addresses?  (If it can't deal with business names, app gets deleted.)  Then, does the app accurately find/identify the business?  (If it offers only one suggestion 900 miles away . . .  Yup, you guessed it: app gets deleted.  And finally, can the app automatically capture the business' address to plot the route?

Recently the app incorrectly named multiple state highways and had me turning onto other roads (twice yesterday) because it thought the highway I was on ended then started back up in a short distance, which I could see they did not break. Loading maps to local device is nice, but the network routing needs help. Also, I like to plan my own route and preciously the software pointed me in circles because it thought the waypoint was off road. Creating your own route takes wY too long and has to be done on the device. Very frustrating!!", "Great app. I downloaded North America map and used it between NYC and Montreal. Worked great!", "Looks like no testing was done for recent iOS version, used to work great but not anymore. Goes back to previous screen when I click direction list option. Please fix ASAP.", "I've owned this app for years & now they want money to continue using it. The whole point of BUYING an offline GPS system is so you do not need a data connection & you do not have to keep paying. Too bad, deleting it.", "Copilot gps is an excellent product, put out by an impenetrable, infuriating, utterly frustrating company. Love  the concept, absolutely hate the system. Some time back, I had to delete and reinstall the app on my iPhone. Since then I haven't been able to log in and get at all those perfectly swell features inside. No matter what I do, I. can't  reset my password--nor can I get past the dialogue boxes. I'm in an endless loop and ready to frag something. PLEASE PROVIDE DIRECT EMAIL ACCESS TO SOMEONE WITH A PULSE. Canned FAQs are never enough by themselves.", "I'm disappointed because there is no way to buy a particular region in Europe. If you only want to use it in one or two countries, you have to buy the full map of Europe. Not to mention that you have to buy the full application.

Incredibly useful.  Hats off to the developers - they deserve to be paid for their work.  Reviews of sites are great - especially if you are traveling alone and want to stay safe.", "We use this for everything. Not only shows all campgrounds, but low clearance, food, fuel and overnight parking. I highly recommend this app.", "Makes our travels so much easier.

The app has always provided accurate options to suit our time schedule when and where we choose to travel.", "Traveled from Houston to the Canadian border and back, and this was my go-to app for information.Was always able to find a place to stay it suited my needs.

We\u2019ve used it for cross country trips and it\u2019s always been accurate.  A really great feature is the bridge height info.  This was critical for our safe routing in New England and some mid-western states.", "I found the app difficult to use and wasted more time trying to figure out the app than if I had just called places. The few times I did use it, it was not accurate (I.e. the gas station didn\u2019t have potable water or dump station) wish I could just get my money back since I used it just a few times before getting annoyed.", "The Allstays website is terrible, so I resisted paying for this app for a long time. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised to see that the app is MUCH better than the website, but it could use some improvements for the price tag. \n\nI wish it would remember my filters each time I restart the app. I also wish I could just select all filter items and uncheck a few.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how some parks have ratings with no reviews, but I can\u2019t rate a site without leaving a review. For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t always have the energy to put together a well worded review, and I wish it were possible to just rate key factors (noise, cleanliness, safety, level/ease of parking overall comfort).\n\nI also wish I could flag certain entries for review by admins. One park I found is tent sites only but Allstays says full hookups etc. Another park I found isn\u2019t a park at all\u2014 it\u2019s a parts store.

The old way was much better \u2014 it opened the info box right above the symbol I clicked on.  Seems like a minor point, but if it isn\u2019t fixed, I won\u2019t be using this otherwise great APP anymore.", "We have used this app a LOT from the moment we purchased our very first camper two years ago, and it has been extremely useful.  I really don\u2019t have any complaints about what it DOES offer, but rather a suggestion for what it doesn\u2019t.  We pulled our camper up through Colorado last weekend through a snowstorm.  By the time we made it to our destination our camper was covered in thick layers of mud and ice.  The ice has all melted, but the camper is still very muddy. I looked into having someone come to the park and wash it for us but, good grief, $450?!?  This app is seriously missing out on a big part of RV\u2019ing.  It really needs to also show locations of car washes that have high bays and big parking lots so that RV\u2019ers know where they can take their mobile living quarters to wash them themselves.  That particular feature would be MOST helpful!", "I don't get why this app has a 4.6 rating and suspect I'm either missing some integral help aid or others are just not searching the way I search. I don't find the search bar helpful at all. When entering \"Texas, Dallas, Copper Breaks State Park\" which of course are all known to exist the map moves slightly, but doesn't necessarily center on the search item.\n\nIf you hit the drop-down in the upper right corner, but do not know the affiliation of a park its use is also of little assistance. I attempted looking for a park listed in the Forest River Forum referred to as \"South Llano River SP\" (State Park) and never received even a hint of a hit, yet a Google search clearly identifies the park.\n\nI'm going to keep playing with it, but honestly think Google Earth or other search tools are more effective than All Stays. \n\nI think this app begs for more handles and tools to assist the user.", "Use ever time I change destinations, always have found a good place to stay", "For any RVer.

We used this app to find RV Parks, campgrounds, and overnight parking as first time RVers and found it to be accurate and informative. We use it all the time.

Very straight forward and easy to use and so far all the information in there was up to date. I don\u2019t always manage to master the \u201csearch\u201d feature as another user said . Needs to type in the town , state , and even country sometimes ... though no guarantees it will work  . However my greatest wish is for this app to have a FAVORITES BUTTON.... and probably I emailed the developer every single time they released a new update for the last 6 years or so... still nothing .... kinda\u2019 disappointing ....  Often in our travels we stumble over a hidden gem of a campground that we might not be able to camp at for different reasons and wish I could save it to a favorites list for future visits ... When you cover thousand of miles in one road trip is kinda hard to keep up with all that ...    wouldn\u2019t be wonderful to be able to have your favorite campgrounds in one place -especially when planning for a road trip and need to keep track of your itinerary  and camps booked along the way in the middle of nowhere - instead of taking notes on a piece of paper ( and misplacing them )  .... especially when the \u201csearch \u201c button can\u2019t always keep up with the job ... and certainly unable to search after campgrounds names later ... please, add a FAVORITES button !!!!  You claim you listen to your customers ... Not only you do not listen but now once EVER someone replied to my emails to at least let me k is that I\u2019m wasting my breath... so  I\u2019m not sure what do I need to do in order for that to happen because apparently emailing you every few month with a basic app request  is too challenging for deaf ears ... very disappointing . I\u2019m sorry you fail to see the importance of such feature ... maybe you should get out and test your app in a real life scenario ... thousand of miles away from your home ... that will probably do . \nSo ZERO \u2b50\ufe0f for customer service \n     4 \u2b50\ufe0f for the app for lacking a \u201cFavorites\u201d feature  .

One has to try and remember physical changes such as bends or geographic features to know what road you\u2019re following. I suspect that the road identifiers are imported from a commercial database and the developer has no control over where they are located.

Searching for a specific rv site is beyond frustrating. Search for Ohio (or whatever state) and the state centers on the map. Search for a site (State park, campground etc) nothing happens.

I've been using it for about 3 years now and I live in my RV half the year wandering around North America. \nThe main issue I have is searching larger areas than what shows up when you pick a State & town. Oftentimes nothing shows up for a town when there are RV Parks in the general area, but not listed for that town. \nSearching a region on the map page helps, but it's not always convenient if you don't know the area well. \nAgain, it's a very good app, and 98% accurate. Just not always convenient to find a stop when traveling.", "One of the most useful RV apps I\u2019ve used. Using the map and applying filters to quickly find parks and reviews, dump stations, RV friendly Walmarts, truck stops etc. well worth the few dollars.", "All Stays is indispensable for planning RV trips.  The reviews and info are very helpful.  Only downside is that the photos do not always match the campsite.", "If you are wanting to find places to stay without fees, this is not the app for you. \nThe listings are heavily dominant with paid camping and parks. \nBoring. \niOverlander is a far superior app for free camping and the app is free as well. \nI feel misled with this apps description and regret paying for it.", "This app is pretty descent.

This is most expensive app I had brought but quality is worst than some of free apps!!

When planning our cross country, month long trip, and seeing many raving reviews from full timing even families on YouTube, I decided to make the purchase. This has been an invaluable tool during our journey. We have used the app mainly for free overnight parking, dump stations, locating BLM land and determining if roads to/from the BLM area were maintained and passable.

Although the app has the potential to be great there are several really annoying issues with it; the app freezes up fairly regularly and is so frustrating. The amenities setting that allow you to filter your choices based on your needs has to be reset every time you use the app, it would make life so much easier if they made them \u201csticky\u201d settings so that you only change them when your needs change. You can only find campgrounds by city and I don\u2019t always know what city we\u2019ll be in or how to spell it if it had a region finder that would help tremendously and finally there is no way to save your selections if you are choosing between a few different campgrounds, the ability do do that would also help a lot. So it is a very useful app but it needs some improvements to make it great, upgrade it with the improvements and I\u2019d be willing to pay up to $10.00 for it.", "Great APP we use it all the time when we are traveling.", "I love this app. Not just because it lists every campsite, park, Walmart, rest stop, etc. but because it tells me how far away they are from where I am locate right now.  Gas stops are easy to plan too.  No more going through 4 different books and 3 different to find a place to stop! Best app for small amount of money!", "I\u2019ve used many apps to find the best places to stay, but now I only use this one.

To supplement my planning, I can find potential rest stops, gas stations, and most importantly potential hill grades and low bridges since I tow a travel trailer.\n\nThe application is intuitive to use and many filters to help keep the maps clean and easy to read.

And NOTHING else is chosen in filters. Not very useful to find a campground., Today, I ONLY checked Thousand Trails and if I zoomed in enough, it showed the two campgrounds in Ohio. I then added Low Clearance, went back to the map, and NOTHING showed. Very cumbersome to use and not very helpful. I did get a comment from APP support.

Ya know, you got us thru Yellowstone National Park, much of Wyoming and much of Montana last summer during the busiest tourist season ever!  Seriously, you\u2019ve gotten us around the US a few times now!  Allstays has helped us find the best places to camp even if it was a Walmart.

It lets me know what camp grounds will take my RV length and let me avoid over passes that could damage our coach.  It also has pertinent information like campground phone numbers, and ratings of the campgrounds. The only drawback is, it isn\u2019t able to be use as a trip planner, like APPLE MAPS or Google Maps.", "Last year we traveled around Canada East and US New England.\nIn some removed area, we cannot find cell signal, so google map can\u2019t work, but this map works in detail and works very accurately, amazing!", "Best app for RV life.

We are a travel softball family, and I use the map and reviews on here to find the best spot near a ball tournament as possible. It has yet to let me down!!

Map should move with your travel. Currently it lets you drive right of the edge of the map display. \n\n2.  Save filters.", "Allstays is a great tool for planning a trip to an unfamiliar area. It\u2019s great that it shows ALL types of campgrounds, rest stops and fuel.  It can be a bit difficult to learn to use but once you do it\u2019s pretty invaluable.", "Absolutely, definitively, without question the best camping app ever made.

Love it and can\u2019t imagine doing without it.", "This is the first place I go to start searching for a place to stay.", "I purchased this app for planning an extended motorhome trip which we just completed. It more than paid for itself just by provided easy over night alternatives to expensive RV parks. When we had to change plans, I had all important info right at my fingertips, including repair shops, refueling places and prices, free/cheap places to stay, nice places to stay, shopping, etc. When our GPS chose to go loco, I simply followed my All Stay maps and never went wrong. My only complaint is that conditions on secondary roads aren't specified as they are on the major routes. That info lets us know which routes are best avoided in a motor-coach. I highly recommend this app.", "This app is essentially a collection of links to websites (e.g., private and public campgrounds). So, why bother buying this it when you can scour the internet for these links yourself. The reason is that all of those thousands of links are conveniently compiled in a very intuitive way making it breeze to use. I buy very few apps; this one is worth the money", "I use this app all the time to find camping destinations.  Filter on the app is very nice.  You can chose everything from National Parks to a gas station.  Highly recommend.", "Updated the app and now it's slow, the search doesn't work. Was a great app now just ok.

It hasn\u2019t let me down yet. I love that you can access it even when no internet connection is available!  Also love the convenient links to the campground\u2019s websites when you do have internet.  The low clearance warnings have saved me more than once, and the access to Walmart\u2019s and other places of business is a big plus as well!  Highly recommended!", "We use this not only to plan but during our travels with a 43 ft 5th wheel. I used this app to plan a 5300 mile trip out west and not only did it work perfect but was accurate.

It has always been very helpful.", "Very disappointed you no longer support Android devices... after I paid for both versions.", "Did not find the app any more helpful than googling.  Would not recommend.  Not worth the money.", "The old version was easy to use! I could touch on state parks in a state and they all appeared on a map! Now they are listed by towns! Does not work for me!", "AllStay became my trusted go-to app while traveling across the country last spring.  I really like that it integrates many different RV park types, military, commercial, state and federal.  I would like a category for transitional parks that are converting to stick built homes, like we found in Arizona.  Also a category for parks that cater to seasonal or weekly rentals.  Some of those parks I would like to know to avoid.", "I have been using this app (the paid version) for full-time travels in my Class B camper van for several years now. It\u2019s absolutely the most comprehensive, and most importantly ACCURATE, source of information on campsites, roadside rest areas, RV dump stations, and so much, much more! I have provided reviews, feedback, corrections, updates and additional information for many locations. Sometimes the app developer has contacted me to confirm details of my submission in order to ensure he gives his users the absolute best and most complete information. I have also tried some of the other similar popular apps. While they have some nice features that are appealing, I consistently over the past few years find their data MUCH LESS accurate, reliable or useful. I always return to this app, and consider it the \u201cgold standard\u201d by which to judge all the other flashy but less reliable wanna be apps. You simply won\u2019t find a more accurate or better supported set of absolutely useful and reliable data than in this app.", "Has just about everything you could ask for.

Pick an area, use the filter, find your next camp.", "This is my favorite app. We\u2019re full time RVers and when you\u2019re on the road you can follow your path in this app. Better than the map apps for that by far. You can view everything along the way including RV parks, state and national campgrounds, places to dry camp, dump stations, Walmarts, and so much more. Also shows steep grades and low clearances. I use it many times a day. LOVE IT!!  Wish I could highlight favorite campgrounds with personal notes attached. Also noticed campgrounds missing from the app but that should resolve itself in time as new ones get added. Well worth the $9.99 I paid for it!!", "It\u2019s nice to go to one place to find what I need!!!", "I belong to different clubs, but I like coming here first to get an idea of the different parks in the area.", "Has improved our ability to find camping spots, plan fuel stops and LP.", "Good site, easy to use", "This is the best app for RVing or camping I have come across.

Our conversation would have made a great promo for the app.", "This far everything we have needed to find for either camping supplies, van or chassis supplies or tire repair has been found via this app.  Outstanding!

We go without reservations most of the time and make them just prior to arriving so that we are not locked in any particular schedule.

The map feature is wonderful and makes planning a breeze.", "Thanks, Allstays. This app is my go to when traveling or planning a trip.", "Agree with the reviewer requesting a favorites feature. This is a great app, I use it all the time but wish I could more easily keep track of favorite places.", "We downloaded this app upon a recommendation from a fellow RVing friend and have no regrets. This site is extremely helpful when we\u2019re looking for a campsite while traveling and their connected sites enable making reservations easy. Love the low clearance and store locations too. Overall a great site and we would give it a high recommendation.", "I use this app all the time!!!", "5th year using this app and we consider it the most important tool we have for travel planning and on the fly decision making.

Better than the others in my opinion.", "It\u2019s a great app but recent changes are a big step backwards, as far as being able to set filters before choosing a state.", "We enjoyed this app until it was \u201cupgraded\u201d and forced its users to purchase even more in order to use any of its filters etc. I\u2019ve already purchased the app once, I won\u2019t be purchasing any of these \u201cextras\u201d they stripped us from with the first purchase. Bad business in my opinion.", "The biggest issue is missing RV parks - lots of them. You\u2019ll want to use this in conjunction with other tools to check out all the options for the area you are researching.

We RV full time since 2015.", "The only source we ever use for finding campgrounds - love it!", "This used to be a great app, but the UI was changed in a recent revision and its usefulness is degraded.\n\nStill the information is useful to us even though it\u2019s no longer the standout product it once was.", "I\u2019ve been a traveling Scrub for a long time. Having an Rv is a huge help. But when it comes to finding great places and good rates, nothing beats this app for me. It\u2019s especially helpful when I am heading to a tourist spot. I can find places off the beaten path that\u2019s safe and quiet! When making travel plans I can use this to find gas station and places to stop for the night. Many Walmart\u2019s no longer allow that, so it\u2019s nice to have the info before hand.", "Our go to app. that we use on planning our trip and when in route.  We use the filter to help us locate specific needs as we travel.  Recommended to anyone who travels.", "I used to love this app. Super intuitive to use and book sites.

Bring back the old look!!! 5 star before frustrating as hell now.", "Was a great app they change it can\u2019t find the information I always used to find general areas. To find area I wanted to look at.", "We use this app daily.  We travel more than six months a year. This is the best app there is.

It\u2019s unbelievable and I would gladly have paid or triple for it!", "I just upgraded to the latest version. It did take just a little time to get used to it but, I assure you, it is better than ever. I van camp as a hobby and I love all of the out-of-the-way places that the app shows me that I never seen before. If you have any inkling that you might benefit from the app, just go ahead and buy it and start using it. Example- I like cheap gas and am a Costco member. The app shows me every Costco in the US with just a couple keystrokes.", "This is a must for any type traveler.", "I use the Allstays app religiously. It is the best site to find campgrounds around the country. Unfortunately, their new upgrade blocks access to user reviews from other sites. It also blocks the ability to post reviews on other sites. What made this app so good before was that you could read (and post) reviews on several apps, thereby giving you a wider picture of user remarks. Limiting everything to Allstays only is like throwing blinders on.", "We travel for weeks at a time, and have used this several dozen times to find parks & services. Occasionally a park is missing, but that is what update functions are for. Overall, this is an indispensable tool for the traveler/camper and the absolute best of the seven or eight apps we have tried.", "This app has been our go to source on two major trips. It has never let us down. Just got the new revised updated format. Looks to be more straight forward with respect to reviews. The icon road map is terrific!\nPlanning our next trip right after I submit this.", "Camp and RV has it all.

Great information that was very accurate, we love this app!!!!!  Can't imagine traveling without it and worth every penny.", "This is the best resource we have found to find camping sites!  Use it multiple times on every trip - call phone # for red, look at pictures, etc.  Great app!", "This app has been our life line to all RV parks, repair shop, where to purchase propane, RV supply,  I tell very new be about this tool.  Thanks", "Easy setup, easy to use, and beats the livin\u2019 daylights out of that $500 plus dollar Garmin RV I bought. I may send a thank you note to the thieves who took it out of my car. It\u2019s a positively terrific app.", "Been using this to book all our stays! Love it!", "Best $$ spent on an app!  Love the new update also.  So helpful finding campgrounds that will work for us.  Also the fuel info is very helpful.  Can\u2019t say enough!", "This is the one every traveler must have. It has it all, easy to use, accurate and provides a amazing amount of information. Don\u2019t leave home without it.", "This app was a total waste of my money. The interface is difficult to use and doesn\u2019t show nearly all of the campgrounds that exist. Super upset I spent ten dollars on it", "I love this app for looking for campsite.  A lot of the data is built into the app so even if you lose cell service you can still look for places close by and even still get the info on the place like GPS coordinates or phone numbers.\n\nThere is much more to this app but it is very well designed and easy to use.  I do wish something could be done able the limited zoom area size if too many things being shown.  A grouping of the items would be nice and then expands out as you zoom in.\n\nBut over all this is my primary Camping planning app.", "Why did you take the summary of the location away?  I counted on knowing how many campsites, big rig friendly, pull thrus, etc. plus knowing RV lanes in gas station. Will REALLY miss the summary.", "The reviews are old.  The app has gone down hill for awhile.  Notice there are no new reviews.  Use to love this app.  Wish it would be back to where it was.", "I teach this app for my beginning RV class.

It lets you know wat is available in the target area", "A fellow RV camper suggested Allstays a few days into our vacation last month, and we are so glad he did. We used the app every single day - to find RV parks, laundromats, grocery stores, diesel gas, propane........just about anything we needed. How did we ever manage before Allstays?", "This is a great app ! I use it in our RV, tent camping & motorcycling. It is very complete- lots of good & accurate information plus very easy to use.

I am a full time Rver, and it is my go to for finding my next park!", "I use this app all the time while traveling. Everything from fuel to overnight parking to planning a long weekend", "My husband and I have been full timing for the past few years. Allstays has been our main campsite locator. It\u2019s easy to use, up to date, comprehensive and accurate. The only thing that would make it better would be the ability to filter by RV size. Even without that it\u2019s well worth the money.", "We love this app! New update is great!\nWe are retired and are full time RVers, have using this app for 3 years, best app ever!", "This was my go-to app for campgrounds. I hadn't used it recently, but when I tried today it is basically useless. The campgrounds won't load to their website, it freezes up, and closes. I think it had a recent upgrade, and now it's ruined.  NOOOOOO!", "This app is great for traveling across the States.  Love the filters to pinpoint what your needs are.", "This app has saved us from having to camp at Walmart.  We use this every day when on the road.", "I love this app. We were able to travel from PA to CA and back using this app, almost exclusively, to find new sites. We stayed anywhere from 1 to 4 nights over 7 weeks of traveling with our 17 ft trailer. I did find the mileage was lower than when transferring to a map for directions. It was easy to adjust for this difference. I loved the links to the websites and reservations, as well as the links for reviews and weather. I have recommended it many times during our trip.", "We\u2019re full-timers, and this is the app that makes it possible. I am always recommending this app to anyone who needs to know where to find good camper spots. Priceless!", "My go to app for finding campgrounds along our route.  Lots of info in the database.

Also often I will be in an area that Good San App says there are so many campgrounds and I look at this app and it shows nothing. Even if I click things for my filter, they aren\u2019t there the next time I open the app. I have to check them each time. I mostly got this for the list of Walmarts that might allow you to use their parking lot with permission. Very nice on a rainy late night when I\u2019m nowhere near a campground. It worked once. I have had the best luck with Good Sam. Sorry I wasted my $10.", "This app attempts to provide information on low clearances.  I find it seriously lacking in this regard, particularly in New York and New England.   I have submitted information for updates in Washington and Oregon that we\u2019re lacking but there are so many in the Northeast that it\u2019s overwhelming.  I spend all my time detouring around them so that submitting suggestions is beyond me.

Being able to find so much info on campgrounds, camping stores (or ones that are great for RV\u2019s and camping supplies and food, etc.), RV dealerships, low clearance areas, road grades, and more, all in one app is amazing. Sure some of the sites might be outdated, closed, charge more than app says (even if it says it\u2019s free), or not exactly in right spot, but this is a great app to find what you need without searching the internet for 30 minutes figuring out what you need. (Try finding a NFS campsite on the NFS website when you have no cell service.) One addition that would be awesome is a \u201cboondocking\u201d section to the filter list, where people can submit a camping spot that might not be at an actual campground,  Walmart or truck stop. That would be the cherry on top for the app.", "Loving this app, great accuracy and very addictive.

Each day while we are in an area with cellphone coverage I look up the town we are going to and it shows the camp sites.

Quite a few of the campgrounds in the West don't exist and never have. Some are not where the app says they are. Several BLM and USFS campgrounds particularly the free ones have been shut down for years. I think the app proved right about 80ish % when preferring free campgrounds. \n\n3. The $ symbols do not reflect the layers of other permits necessary to use many state, federal and local campgrounds. This has been particularly true for Washington State. \n\n5.

We're as guilty as a lot of other people about not doing that, so perhaps a prompt in the program that asks \"Where did you stay?...How did you like it?...\" Could be 'accepted' or 'remind me later...'

You can only use the app for an hour for free.", "After entering vehicle info it took us on a route with 5 miles of DIRT road. Waited for 15 minutes for pilot car to lead us 2 miles an hour.

Piece of crap!!!", "It looks like a great app.  I\u2019m very disappointed that I didn\u2019t get to use it because as soon as I asked it to \u2018plan route\u2019 it asked me to subscribe.  $9.99/7 days, $29.99/? mths or $49.99 yrly.", "I don\u2019t know who gave this thing 5 stars.

We LOVE it!  We have been traveling for 3 months using it each travel day and it has been wonderful.  It is a very good tool for any size RV.  You put all of your RV specs into the settings (i.e. Height, weight, length) and it routes according to the best route for your rig.  You can choose, most highway, RV quickest, or RV fastest.  You can't go wrong with his app.", "Says it's free, but doesn't let you use the GPS without paying.", "We have test run this but at some points very confusing.  Following the map portion is okay but when you go to the written instructions to look ahead the prior instructions are still there so you have to search the list to your current location.

Quickest install to delete for me so far.  Oh well, the truck version did not have good reviews.", "I downloaded this and it will not open.", "Junk, don't do it, it set me on a route that was NOT safe for my family in our RV.

The design, the set up, the user friendliness, little icons.... With that being said the only flaw I see is it\u2019s missing the county parks and city.

Worked better than my GPS at times on a trip across country in summer of 2019. I love it. I don\u2019t  normally write reviews, but I did on the campgrounds, because others were so helpful.", "I don\u2019t plan a trip anymore without this app!

What I like best is the fact that this app has two different views map and satellite.

Saves a lot of time instead of a google search where all you get is ads.", "Numerous apps to choose from, but this one has been our favorite for the past 2 years.

I am satisfied enough with it that it\u2019s the only one I use.", "Pulled my camper from South Carolina to Utah. Used this App there and back. I liked the map, the reviews and mileage from your location. We would drive until lunch then look about 230 to 250 miles down the road for campgrounds.

It is very dependable.", "I use this app all the time as we travel. It has become invaluable to me. All the information and reviews of locations are so helpful. One suggestion, and it may already be in the app and I\u2019m missing it. Please add an option to note free WiFi locations. This would help me a lot!  Still 5 stars without that feature though.", "The free version is great, I only wish more people would rate the parks. This app not only shows the parks, stores and fuel but also low clearences.", "Great app! I use it to find free dump stations and campgrounds.

Good accurate information and highly recommend!", "What I have found is occasionally the campground is closed/changed hands/ or private.  Some local/town campgrounds are not listed.

Love it!", "The essential app for Road trippers, it gives info with driving directions to rest stops, gas stations, Walmart stores and off course camp grounds.", "Don\u2019t normally write reviews but this app is great.  Shows all the typical campgrounds, but what I really like is the fact that it also shows all the state parks and campgrounds.  Also shows all the National campgrounds, national Forests, National recreation areas, etc. Also shows county and city parks and whether or not they have a campground there.  I\u2019ve stayed in some nice county and city campgrounds that I never would have known about without this app.  it also tells you the distance between your current location and the one that you are looking at.

Even better than some I paid $ - highly recommend!", "I haven\u2019t been disappointed yet. I use the app to find safe places when I\u2019m traveling in my Airstream Interstate 3500 on holiday. Prices are in the $35 range, as a rule. Parks can be more rustic but mostly they are run by nice folks who keep the grass mowed & maintain facilities. Some parks don\u2019t have restrooms or showers, just electric, water, sewer for the RV, FYI. So tent camping isn\u2019t always desirable. My advice? Call ahead.

Beautiful setting.  Large trees, very clean facilities.  Their saltwater pool is open Memorial Day through Labor day.  We had a large pull through that was very easy to pull in.

Lots of info that we found accurate plus mapping and such. Quite sure it would also be quite useful for advance planning .", "While no app out there is perfect, this app is effective in helping find cost efficient places to overnight. The low clearance notification is extremely helpful when planning a route. I love the public lands listings showing free places to stay overnight while traveling. It will remain in my inventory of go-to apps for route planning and destination searching.\n\nCons of this app is lack of info at several of the locations and very few images. \n\nOverall a very good app.  I travel for work all over the country and am a full-time camper resident.

I thank all of the people that review good or bad.", "Great for locating campgrounds, but they apparently had the wrong web addresses for Illinois state parks. I had to use Reserve America.", "App is great. Only suggestion is that it would be cool to be able to search for campgrounds with showers! Or search for the places that allow overnight parking. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to pull over to go click on every location to see the info and all Walmart\u2019s or stops don't allow parking overnight.", "Traveling around US and Canada!

We tend to stay in KOAs, but where there weren't any - this helped us find great places.", "All we could ask is to add the price per night as one of your competitors does, however that other app otherwise falls far short of your great features.

We weren\u2019t sure how far we would be able to get each day with the unpredictability of the kids so this app saved us! We were able to use it whenever we needed to find a stop for the night or a stop immediately when the kids needed a break.

I had a small one man tent and found that most \"Campgrounds\" cost almost as much as a motel and are really RV parks is disguise.

It is also handy for locating showers, laundry etc. at those RV campsites.\n\nMost of the dispersed campsite were accurately marked, a few were within a quarter mile of were the app said but there were a couple I could not find. 99% of the time I was looking for the sites in the late night/early morning so there is a chance that conditions prevented me from seeing them. 2 sites I had to use a real GPS to navigate because of loss of cellphone service.

Used to tediously use the map app to figure out our stopping points and then search the other apps for places to stay. No longer need ALLSTAYS for Walmart, Love\u2019s and Flying J! The RV Parky trip planner makes it so easy to figure out our hours & milage to the next stop. My new favorite app!!!", "Really? How can I plan a trip with the app if I have to start over every time I change my mind?

Deleted immediately.", "Best of the best. And free.", "I paid for Allstays and now regret it. RV Parky is so user friendly with all information up front, no extra clicking. Great for short or long trips. Quick access to reviews helped us sort thru the good bad and ugly stops along our routes. No wasting time guessing which station has what access. Thank you RV Parky!", "Planned 2 trips with app. Super easy and you can share it with friends. Don\u2019t travel without it!", "Overall I like the app.  However, the filter doesn\u2019t filter your results.  For instance, when I select 4 star rated or higher I get lower rated campsites. When I select showers as a must have amenity I get sites without showers, etc.  Fix that and I\u2019ll raise my rating.", "I do not find this app user friendly at all. I\u2019m trying to plan a trip from near Buffalo NY to near Clearwater Florida. Tried create trip and entered starting city. No where to put in the final destination. No choices of routes were listed. No listing of RV parks and gas stations etc. I don\u2019t understand this app at all. Maybe it\u2019s me but it\u2019s just of no use to me at all. Much better luck with Mapquest but would love to have a list of RV parks along my chosen route to Florida.", "We have loved the app but now it\u2019s crashing so much we can\u2019t use it.  Select a campground and before you can review info it crashes. Every time. iPhone X, 8 or iPad Pro.

I frequently contribute reviews to expand the database.\nThe developer has always answered my emails when I\u2019ve sent him recommendations or comments.  Commendable!", "Used the app for the first time on a recent trip, and we will never travel without it again. We had to make a lot of last minute adjustments on a trip we had been planning for months, so I searched for an app to help find campgrounds.

The map to see where these parks are, the ease of checking availability, just not easy like it used to be.", "Planning our 9 month trip I used 3 apps suggested by others. RVParky was by far my go to. It\u2019s easy to use and 98% of the parks are there with many reviews as compared to the other apps. My only ask would be to include max length for state/national parks.", "I\u2019ve been using this app for a while however this newest update lost the simplistic feature of clicking on a map and highlighting a campground and telling me all about the campground.

I've found suitable sites from Florida to Northern Minnesota.", "We travel all year for work, and have been for 3 years.  This app beats ANY other CG apps, even the ones I have memberships with.

Last year switched to an iPhone using same RV Parky app, but there's a real drop in quality in how the app functions.  It's not nearly as intuitive with search and wording used, that is, it's functions are much slower and app is constantly searching and pausing. Otherwise, the RV Parky app is a good collection of sites and ratings; although needs better input from users and occasionally misses the mark in description, phone numbers, closings, or isn't even aware of some good RV parks that exist, but can find them on Google or Allstays. Site users who do the rating of these parks sometimes just want to vent about insignificant dribble, therefore should have means within site for feedback of that users useless rating.", "Could not have done the 18,000 mile trip without this app.  THANKS!", "Used it many times!", "This is so much user friendly.

By then I rank the top two or three based on our criteria and price, and make the calls. And do this all in the coach while my husband drives!

The drive was from Portland to crescent city. We booked the day of after we had already arrived in town around 4pm and grabbed some dinner. We had kinda lucked out as there was only 1 spot left for full hookups. The lady answering the phone was super nice and said they only had a 50 amp spot left and I\u2019d need to get An adapter for my 30 amp cord. I picked one up for $20 and headed to the RV Park. This place is beautiful. It\u2019s planted in a heavily wooded redwood tree grove and most spots are separated pretty decently so it\u2019s almost like you have your own little forest. My spot #80 was a little tricky to back into with my 16 foot travel trailer because it sat at an angle but was able to get it into place with out too much maneuvering. Went to hook up and the site had a 50 amp and a standard 110 GFCI outlet ( Which I already had an adapter for) so I didn\u2019t need to pick up a 50-30 adapter but not a problem cus it\u2019s good to have anyhow. Anyhow the check in was nice each campsite has its own fire ring. The main reason we came here was because it seemed kid friendly and it didn\u2019t disappoint. There were. Bunch of kids and lots of activities near the office including a nice playground. My daughter had a great time with the other kids. The only downside was I wasn\u2019t able to use the WiFi in my trailer which isn\u2019t the worst thing but would have been nice to relax after such a long trip and watch a movie or something. Anyhow we paid 62 dollars for the night with full hookups, with cable, a bit steep but worth it if you get a good site. Ours was super quiet despite being close to the 101 freeway. There is a cool walking trail as well onsite so be sure to check that out on the west end of the park. The office person did warn me of potential break ins and theft around crescent city so be sure tuck belonging away just to be safe but we had no issue. They sell firewood and if I heard correctly it was 16 dollars for a bundle so bring your own if that\u2019s the case haha.

They bragged about how useful this app was for finding free camping locations.\nI have not found this app to be worth the money, it does not have as complete a set of free and pay sites, as other camping apps I am using.\nI would not recommend buying this app.\nIn addition, after some use, the app REQUIRES you to sign up to continue to use the app.  I didn\u2019t plan on this.", "I absolutely love this app! Soooo helpful! Thank app creators! Lol", "30 amp 50 amp. Water sewer. Free. It doesn\u2019t get any better than this. We will stay here on the way back. We just would have been happy with a parking spot. But Walsh! An oasis on free.", "We are on a 2 week road trip and this app has been so helpful! We are finding great campgrounds along the way.", "This site is a good source of information for campers. I would recommend it highly. We used this for our first vacationing in new areas we have not been too. \nThe information about the campground is limited but with us campers putting in reviews, pictures and information helps others.\nI am very glad we found this.:)", "Campendium is an excellent amp for finding the right place to camp. The App is very user friendly and so well laid out. We love that they include cell phone coverage in their site info pages!", "Searching for a place.  We are newbies and this has been invaluable.  Hope to see a big rig friendly search capability soon.", "We recently stayed at the RV Park after the National Park Campgrounds filled up. We can honestly say that it was a great experience staying at San-Suz-Ed. The new owners Jason & Katie (& family) made us fill right at home, and they are making improvements to the campground daily. We were sad to leave after 4 days, and would have loved to stay longer. The RV Park was full, but it never felt crowded and was always peaceful and quiet at night. We had fun sitting around the community campfire in the evenigs and sharing stories while our daughter made new friends. We definitely recommend this campground to anyone looking, and we will be back next year for sure. Some sites are back in, and others are pull through. We stayed in two sites, 17 & 24. Both sites were easy to get in and didn\u2019t require much to level the trailer, a few block under the tires to help, this is the Mountains after all.", "No matter where we are, we\u2019ve found campgrounds that suit our preferences. I love that dispersed camping and boondocking sites are included.", "We try to always stay here. Facilities are always clean staff are really nice!!  They have a full schedule for the kids each day if they want to participate. Sites are nice. (WiFi is only close to the office- or the last time we were there)", "Best app to find spots to boondock and dump!", "Who ever developed this app it\u2019s great!! I travel a lot and I\u2019m easily able to find the best rate closest well maintained camp sites around me. Easy to use accurate fast. I consider this app part of my camping gear!", "App could not find my location.  Just error messages", "I was very excited to use this app. However, it keeps crashing and I have to start my search all over. Not sure I\u2019ll keep it.", "You can\u2019t look around without creating an account. I couldn\u2019t remember my password so I reset it but it kept saying I had to verify my account but it wouldn\u2019t say how or where. Going to RV PARKY. Easier to use.", "The app is invaluable in finding campsites both off the beaten path in BLM or forest service land as well as in national parks with larger campgrounds. Great filters and information from reviewers.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve tried several times to review multiple campsites within the app and it is not saving those reviews - I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a bug or just me doing something wrong, but it would be nice if I could contribute with reviews on the campgrounds I\u2019ve visited.", "Shouldn't be forced to sign up at all. Didn't get into one search before the pop-up demanded I sign up! Personally I'd rather have the option after using it...", "I love this app! \n\nThe website has always been great but I\u2019m totally excited that there\u2019s an app now. I\u2019m on my phone all the time, so this has been a real game changer. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t believe how many FREE campsites there are to choose from. I\u2019ve been able to find at least one in every state we\u2019ve been to (30 so far!).\n\n10/10 definitely recommend!!", "Campendium is my \u201cgo to\u201d app for finding great places to camp.  Not only is the database among the most complete,  but the users put a lot of time and effort into writing their reviews which are among the most detailed available anywhere. Don\u2019t leave home without this app!", "I love this app! Well maintained and the peer reviews are great. \n\nOnly two items I\u2019d change would be an easier option for signing in and a way to \u201cStar\u201d or \u201cfavorite\u201d where I have been and where I\u2019d like to go. Much like a wishlist.", "Why can\u2019t I create \u201clists\u201d and \u201cbookmarks\u201d? It\u2019s a pretty massive failure for this app to allow me to research campgrounds and then I have to copy and paste the info into a different app. Seriously?! I\u2019ll use other apps if that\u2019s the case.", "Seriously guys, if you are into Rving, camping and road trips this app right here is a must have.\n\nSi les gusta acampar con casas m\u00f3viles o simplemente viajar por carretera est\u00e1 es la aplicaci\u00f3n que necesitan.", "Campendium is our number one tool to find our next camping destination. There\u2019s a great wealth of information and photos on so many campsites, RV park and campgrounds. The app makes it easy to search by location. Once you have found that perfect spot, click on maps for immediate directions. You can also go right to the campsites website or reservations link. \n\nGreat app and a great solution.", "This is my go to app to find awesome camping sites and to check on cell coverage. Thanks for making an awesome app!!", "Love this app. If I could add one feature it would be to select the future bucket list campgrounds in a favorite list.", "My husband and I have been on the road for nine months and just found out about Campendium about two months ago. It has been a life changer. We have camped for free in some of the most beautiful places! We have camped directly on the rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, with the view of Twin lakes in Colorado, on the Vermillion Cliffs in Utah and many other wonderful places. Most places will have a fire ring as well! So thankful it has become an app! The app works so well and we are excited to continue to use it! @mcgee.ventures", "We are super excited to be using the campendium app! Their website is wonderful and I'm sure the app will be even better!", "Finally, this stellar app takes the authority of online campground reviews to the next level. As a full-time RVer I cannot thank the developers enough for this invaluable resource!", "This app is crazy useful. I love Campendium!", "We love the filters and map function!", "So happy this is finally out! Campendium is how I find most of my campsites, and now it's going to be all that easier to access it. Thanks guys!", "If you are new to camping or a seasoned pro, this app offers the most reliable reviews for campgrounds.", "We've been using the Campendium website for the past 3 years, and it took our full timing to the next level. Now with the convenience of just opening the app, it's just unbelievable. Why spend time Googling campgrounds or scouring NF or BLM maps for spots that may or may not work out. Just open the app find what kind of spot suits your needs, and you'll know exactly what to expect when you get there.", "As a full-time traveler, the Campendium website has been an indispensable tool in my arsenal since its inception. This app is a game changer, as it's so simple to research places to stay now on the fly on my phone. Everything works great, and all the info is right where I need it. Great filters, maps, and so easy to use and find the info I want. Bravo!", "...and it's perfect. Best resource to plan a journey, or when you need to change plans on the fly. Thank you for creating this app!", "I always refer to Campendium first when picking camping destinations...now things have become even easier with the app. The user interface is intuitive and the campground reviews (including cell coverage) from REAL people who have stayed there is super useful. Reviews also include photos from reviewers, not campground owners, so I feel like I'm getting a better idea of what the campground actually looks like before I decide to stay there. It also makes it easy to find boondocking options. \nI love this app!", "My husband and I have used Campendium for the past 2 years to find the best campsites in America, Canada and Mexico. The cell service reports are awesome because working online is how we fund our travels. Great campsites, informative reviews, and the only place to find cell reports, too. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f", "Campendium is my go to when finding places to stay in our RV.  I am glad all the things I love about the website were put into this app. The app makes it so much easier when we are traveling to find an RV park with reviews and places to boondock when we want to get away from it all.  This is a must have for people traveling in an RV!", "Put in a few dozen searches and used the map markers to bring the selection to top of list. Nice feature. Seems accurate as I used a few spots we have camped that are off the grid ... got usable results. A nice tool to have in the trVels", "Just like their website, which we have been using for years... this app has amazing filters to help you find the kind of site you want!  We rarely make plans and this helps us find amazing places as we travel (full-time for nearly 3yrs).  We work from the road and this is THE app/website to use to know before you commit to a campground or boondocking spot if the cell signals are usable.", "I've been using Campendium's website for a long time when looking for campsites. This app makes it more convenient. It's accurate and fast.\nSomeday it would be nice to be able to download info and save it, so one could use when off the grid. \nNow, I'll continue to plan ahead and search  for sites when online. This is a great tool!", "We have been a huge fan of Campendium from the beginning so we are thrilled that now there is an app! \n\nSo far it has worked exceptionally well and it's very streamlined and simple to use.
